# ReduxStore
22. State Challenge 

## Purpose
In this module, you learned how to manage global state using React’s Context API. The Context API is quickly gaining traction as a worthy alternative or perhaps even successor to other libraries that manage global state in tandem with React, such as Flux or MobX. Nonetheless, the open-source JavaScript library Redux remains the industry standard for managing complex state in a large-scale React application, and it’s very likely that you’ll encounter it on the job.
